# money-for-time

## Brief Overview:
The user can add a time to his/her file and can get how much money he/she can have for the given time inputs.

### Why was this program made?
During second semester of my second year of undergrad, I thought of the idea to incentivize the time I put in studying and doing necessary coursework. Instead of writing down the hour/minutes I spend on doing school work, I made this simple program.

### Update:
I have added a simple database system usign SQLite integrated in the Python files for a more proficient way of saving and restoring of data.

### How to run it:

Fork the repo and in the terminal,

> python3 moneyForTime.py
